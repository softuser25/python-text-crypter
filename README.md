# python-text-crypter
My simple python encrypt and decrypt program.

This program uses MIT license so you can edit,view and share everything in this code.

HELP:First you will get question:Do you want to encrypt,decrypt or generate password.Your choices are e,d and p.
Every time you do an operation,program will ask you for password.I set it to empty(You can just press enter and operation starts) but you can edit it later.

Encryption-Decryption:Type a message you wish to send to your friend.The program will make it so no one will understand that message except people that have the program(encrypted).Tell your friend to pick Decryption and he will type your encrypted message.Program will make it understandable so he can read it properly.

Generate password:I added this for no reason.It's just a function that asks you how many characters do you want in your password.It will generate a complicated password.Then you can use that password for example on facebook if you dont want anyone to log in without your permisson.Brute force attacks stand no chance with one of those passwords.
